Hello world!

### W2
Debug: Missing one ";" from the coding we should uncomment.
1. RGB color is defining how bright for Red, Green, and Blue, it is a continueous status of number value so we use float.
2. Bounce is counted and is counted by completion so it can only be integer.
3. The error is in fact the change of the ball after every bounce.
### W3
parameters: int friendshipLevel & Boolean knownScret
Return type: String characterResponse

In class activity:
1. The class is just like a toolbox and members are tools in the box. The tools are put together in the same box for the ease of use. Using Method is like taking a tool to do something, and member variables are those component being frequently used in many methods.
2. Maybe the balls are changed by adding RGB values when bouncing instead of randomize RGB so the total brightness is increased each time bouncing.
